# Auto-status
Auto-status is a Dalamud plugin that automatically toggles your in-game status based on whether the game's window is focused.

## What it does
- Sets a chosen status (e.g., /afk) when the game loses focus.
- Restores a chosen status when the game regains focus.
- Lets you pick which statuses to use in the settings window.

## How to use
- Open the settings window with `/autostatus` or `/aus`.
- Choose your focused and unfocused statuses.
- Alt-tab away from the game to trigger the unfocused status.
- Return to the game to restore the focused status.
